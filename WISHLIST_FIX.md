# Wishlist User Isolation Fix

## Problem
The wishlist was showing the same items for all users instead of being user-specific. This was caused by improper state management when users switch accounts.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **State Management Issue**: The auth state change listener in ProductController wasn't properly reactive to user changes
2. **Missing Security Rules**: Firestore security rules didn't include proper user-specific access controls for wishlists
3. **Insufficient Data Clearing**: When users switched accounts, the wishlist data wasn't being properly cleared and reloaded

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Auth State Listener
**File**: `lib/controllers/product_controller.dart`
- Fixed the reactive listener to properly detect user changes
- Added comprehensive debugging to track state changes
- Ensured wishlist data is cleared when user signs out
- Added explicit user identification in all wishlist operations

### 2. Enhanced Firestore Security Rules
**File**: `firestore.rules`
- Added specific rules for wishlists collection:
```javascript
// Wishlists collection - users can only access their own wishlist
match /wishlists/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                       (request.auth.uid == userId || 
                        request.auth.token.isAdmin == true);
}
```

### 3. Improved Database Service Logging
**File**: `lib/services/firebase_db_service.dart`
- Added detailed logging to track which user's wishlist is being accessed
- Enhanced error handling and debugging information

### 4. Added Debug Tools
- Added debug buttons in wishlist screen to trace state
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the wishlist flow
- Added methods to force refresh wishlist data

## How to Test the Fix

### Test Scenario 1: Basic User Isolation
1. **User A Login**: Login with first user account
2. **Add Items**: Add some items to wishlist
3. **Logout**: Sign out completely
4. **User B Login**: Login with second user account  
5. **Check Wishlist**: Verify wishlist is empty (not showing User A's items)
6. **Add Different Items**: Add different items to User B's wishlist
7. **Switch Back**: Logout and login as User A again
8. **Verify**: User A should still see only their original items

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Device Testing
1. Use different devices or browsers for each user
2. Verify wishlists remain isolated across devices
3. Test simultaneous usage by different users

## Updated Firestore Rules Deployment

**IMPORTANT**: You must update your Firebase Firestore rules for the security fix to work:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** â†’ **Rules**
4. Replace the existing rules with the updated rules in `firestore.rules`
5. Click **"Publish"**

## Debugging Features Added

### 1. Debug Button in Wishlist Screen
- Added bug report icon in wishlist screen app bar
- Tap to see detailed state information in console

### 2. Manual Refresh Button
- Refresh icon in wishlist screen to force reload data
- Useful for testing state changes

### 3. Enhanced Console Logging
Look for these debug messages in Flutter console:
- `Auth state changed - User: [email]`
- `Loading user data for: [email]`  
- `FirebaseDbService: Getting wishlist for user: [userId]`
- `Loaded X wishlist IDs from Firestore: [ids]`

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for user-specific logging messages
2. **Verify User IDs**: Ensure each user operation shows correct user ID
3. **Test State Clearing**: Confirm wishlist clears when logging out
4. **Database Inspection**: Check Firebase Console to see user-specific documents

## Potential Additional Issues

If the problem persists, check:

1. **App State Reset**: Force close and restart the app between user switches
2. **Clear App Data**: In device settings, clear app data to remove any cached information  
3. **Firebase Rules**: Verify the new Firestore rules are published and active
4. **Network Issues**: Ensure stable internet connection for real-time updates

## Files Modified

1. `lib/controllers/product_controller.dart` - Fixed auth listener and added debugging
2. `lib/controllers/auth_controller.dart` - Enhanced user tracking and exposed reactive user
3. `lib/services/firebase_db_service.dart` - Added comprehensive logging
4. `lib/screens/wishlist_screen.dart` - Added debug tools
5. `firestore.rules` - Added user-specific security rules

The wishlist should now be properly isolated per user. Each user will only see and can only modify their own wishlist items.
